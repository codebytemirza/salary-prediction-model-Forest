**## Salary Prediction Model**

**### Overview**
This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting salaries based on various factors such as education level, job title, and years of experience. The model is trained using Random Forest Regression, a powerful algorithm for predicting continuous variables.

**### Key Features**
- Utilizes Random Forest Regression to predict salaries.
- Input features include education level, job title, and years of experience.
- Provides accurate salary predictions for individuals based on their profile information.
- Enables data-driven decision-making in career planning and salary negotiations.

**### Getting Started**
To get started with using the model:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas) using `pip`.
3. Load the pre-trained model and use it to make predictions on new data.

**### Usage**
1. Prepare input data containing education level, job title, and years of experience.
2. Use the pre-trained model to predict salaries for the input data.
3. Analyze the predictions to make informed decisions about career paths and salary negotiations.
